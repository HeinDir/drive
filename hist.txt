Hi All,
 
I was never sure when it would be my turn to send one of these emails, but you have to keep changing for things to stay interesting.  After almost 11 years I will be leaving Avid. 
 
From Pro Tools 6.4 (Otis) to S6L, I have had the pleasure of working with so many amazing people on the Dev Services, Plug-ins, Live Sound, and EUCON teams.  It was an amazing opportunity to participate in many of the coolest products in the world like Eleven Rack, HDX, S3, PT|Control, and S6L.  I am humbled when looking back at the talent and dedication of the people at this company, from the Digidesign days to its more recent formulations.  You are so smart and have such a focused belief in making the audio and media world a more exciting place.  I look forward to seeing what will come next as you continue to bring these products into a more collaborative and networked form.
 
My last day will be Wednesday, January 20.  I hope to stay in touch via email or linkedin.
 
Absolute Best Wishes,
Bob


So this day has come, when I'm should say good bye to you guys. It was nice three years I spent here in GL, but a lot of discoveries and opportunities waiting for me and I hope for you everyone in future.
Assuming it is my last working day here I'm having a joy to invite you to taste some pizza and drinks at 3C kitchen today at 4:00 PM

Dear Folks!
It seems that it is my turn to step out and say "Thank you very much and Goodbye!"...
It was real pleasure to work with each of you and learn from you..not everything went well sometimes for us, but this is life as is;)
I'm wishing you all the best on your way, hoping all we will stay in contact

I'll continue my work in GL, but for other account, so we will remain close to each other;)

My transition period formally ends in a week, so please approach me with your action items till next Thursday. Due to possible re-org in Avid this transition may be prolonged informally, and I hope I'll share with you our new org structure as soon as we receive some clear picture from Avid folks.

With kind regards,
Eugene

It’s been a great run (10 years!), but my time has come to leave Avid. After working in Avid engineering offices on both coasts, and visits to others around the world, I remain humbled to work with such talented and passionate people. Thank you all for the experience. 

My remaining time will be focused on transition. Please reach out privately if you want to pick my brain about anything. My last day at Avid will be Wednesday, February 10. 

Please keep in touch - I’m on LinkedIn, and my personal email is rommelmanuel@gmail.com.

Thank you!

Hi everyone,
 
As many of you already know I’ve decided to leave Avid and mine last working day will be this Friday, 2/26. 
 
We have done a lot of great things together since I’ve joined Avid more than 4 years ago. It was real pleasure for me working on strategic projects and seeing how they are changing direction of Avid business. Unified licensing, migration of ecommerce engine to SFDC based, implementation of subscriptions and support contracts, freemium software, platform initiative and in app purchases – all of this were small pieces of something big, of Avid’s strategy to be leading in industry.
 
I would like to thank you all for opportunity working and learning from you, for supporting me during mine trip with Avid.
Wish all the best for you and for Avid!
 
If you would like to keep in touch you are always welcome using email or skype – mir4ik@hotmail.com or LinkedIn.
